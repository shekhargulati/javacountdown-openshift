headline=Move to the latest Java today!

intro=15 years ago an amazing programming language was born. Its name was Java. Now that \
we're in 2013, the world has changed and Java along with it! For Java versions 4, 5 and 6, \
it's time to say goodbye. This website is dedicated watching Java 4, 5 & 6 usage drop to less \
than 1% worldwide, so hundreds of millions of users are safer and 9-10 million developers are \
more productive.

security.headline=Secure Java
security.text=In particular, Java in the Browser (aka Applets) can have security \
issues so you need to protect yourself! <strong>Java on the server is generally safe, but you should upgrade regardless</strong>. \
Here are <a href="https://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/downloads/download/64-New-Things-in-Java-7.pptx" style="color: black" target="_blank">64 extra good reasons</a> (PPT) to move to Java 7 today!

If you're using Java on the server then upgrade your JRE/JDK \

the support you need to keep your business and your customers safe.

latest.text=Java 7u51 will have <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/new_security_requirements_for_rias>further security features</a>. \
Please help ensure that popular projects like ANT <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55542">stay secure</a> by watching and upvoting their \
security upgrades.

layershift.headline=Powered by Layershift, GlassFish and Jelastic!
layershift.text=Layershift are one of the Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best kept secrets, quietly working in the background, powering a number of high street brands. They describe themselves as managed hosting experts, with services spanning 3 continents.</p><p>Layershift's Jelastic PaaS powers this site. It offers a reliable hosting platform for Java and PHP projects (Ruby - coming soon) on your own self-scaling preconfigured role-based servers. Even though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re preconfigured, you still get access to all major config. files for extra flexibility and control.</p><p>Layershift include industry-leading 24x7 technical support, server backups, and a robust SLA as standard - not hidden extra costs. Check out <a href="http://www.layershift.com/hosting/jelastic-cloud?utm_source=javacountdown&utm_medium=profile&utm_campaign=countdown">Layershift's free 14 day Jelastic trial</a> to save time and money on your next project.
layershift.j_headline=Jelastic Uses Standard Stacks
layershift.j_text=Instead of trying to redefine new \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandards\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the Jelastic platform takes a different approach. It provides a completely standard set of mature software stacks. That makes it much easier to work with, and means your standard code can be taken right from your dev. server and deployed without modification. No need to waste any time rewriting to suit specific platform APIs or fight with strange platform constraints. This is the simplicity of cloud hosting as it should be.
layershift.j2_headline=Highly Scalable
layershift.j2_text=Sudden traffic surge? Low traffic overnight? Don't worry, the Jelastic platform provides zero-setup automatic vertical scaling, which quickly and automatically adds and removes resources (cloudlets) to your environment as needed.</p><p>On Jelastic, you pay for resource usage rather than resource allocation - a subtle difference which saves a huge amount of money (some users reported saving 50% or more, just by switching their project to host on the Jelastic platform instead of a basic IaaS such as AWS).</p><p>You can also easily add additional servers for horizontal scaling, and your code is seamlessly auto-deployed and load-balanced across them in just a few clicks.
